Hi, I'm Keegan Lillo, a front-end web software engineer based in Melbourne,
Australia.

Originally starting out as a full-stack web developer, I have since focused on
the front end working with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Typescript.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) I have a strong passion for user
experience (UX) and design. I enjoy working closely with designers and pride
myself on my ability to form professional relationships based on trust and
mutual respect. I have an academic background in design and a career in software
engineering. This provides me with a unique perspective and allows me to help
bridge the gap between design and engineering teams.

I have spent the majority of my career in the San Francisco Bay Area in various
capacities across the tech stack. However, I have always found myself enjoying
visual and interactive experiences the most. I loved my time there, and after
five amazing years collectively at
[Pebble](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)>),
[Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com), and
[Viv Labs (Bixby)](https://bixby.developer.samsung.com/) I returned home to
Melbourne at the end of 2019. I'm now searching for my next adventure, hopefully
in a capacity where I can pursue my passions and give back to the world.
