title: Giving Back
template: portfolio
```
After working in the commercial world for the majority of my career, feeding the great machine of consumerism, I am now starting to give back to the world. I am volunteering my experience and skill set to organisations that would otherwise not be able to afford bespoke technical solutions. Allowing organisations to save on budget, so they can put funds back into strengthening their cause, is the reason I do what I do.
