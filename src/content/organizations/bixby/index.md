In late 2016 Samsung acquired Viv Labs, a San Jose, CA based company founded by the team that created Siri. Operating as a startup-style, wholly owned subsidiary, Viv Labs was tasked with bringing its technology into the Samsung family as the brains behind its next generation personal assistant, Bixby. I worked on the Bixby Developer Platform which provides a comprehensive set of tools that make it easy for third-party developers to teach Bixby how to interact with their products and services, paving the way for innovative user engagement.
