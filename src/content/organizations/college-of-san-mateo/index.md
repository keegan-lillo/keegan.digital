  content: Keegan Lillo presented ‘Beyond the Online Portfolio’ as part of the
    College of San Mateo's Artist/Graphic Design Lecture Series in 2018. Over
    200 students attended to hear how to stand out from the crowd in applying
    for their first jobs, as well as Mr. Lillo's personal take on his own
    professional experiences, what they can expect after graduation and how to
    set up a portfolio website. Mr. Lillo greatly contributed to our goal in
    this series to prepare students for life after the classroom.

As part of the College of San Mateo Artist/Graphic Design Lecture Series, I was invited to give a talk on my professional experience, as well as provide the students an honest look into what they can expect from the design industry. This also included some advice on how to stand out from the crowd when applying for their first jobs. Plus a crash course on how to get set up with a portfolio website.
