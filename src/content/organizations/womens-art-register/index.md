  content: Keegan has been a tremendous help to our organisation. As a diverse
    community with a longstanding history of over 45 years, we are challenged
    with a range of systems, skills, and experience amongst our volunteer
    workforce. Having Keegan so generously donate his time to support our work
    has provided us with valuable skills, up to date information and a clear
    understanding of what we need to support us in our activities. Keegan has
    also delivered his services to us in very clear and straightforward language
    with useful training materials included, which has been a bonus! The Women's
    Art Register would highly recommend Keegan and appreciate his dedication and
    commitment in support of the nonprofit Sector.

In late 2020, the Women’s Art Register underwent a major rebranding and image modernisation. My piece of the puzzle was customising their Squarespace site to reflect their design vision, as well as help insert content. I now provide ongoing technical consultation for a wide range of technical needs.
