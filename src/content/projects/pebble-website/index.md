Being one of the main ways we sold our products to the world, the Pebble website was extremely critical to the business. I was responsible for laying out and styling the site as well as some back-end API integrations. We utilised A/B testing (Optimizely) to help inform our design and UX decisions (along with some gut instinct). Otherwise, from a front-end perspective, it was a reasonably straightforward e-commerce site. The real challenge was in the back-end, linking orders to our fulfilment partners as well as keeping our finance software (NetSuite) in sync as orders were processed and fulfilled.
