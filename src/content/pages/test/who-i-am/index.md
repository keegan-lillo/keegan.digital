Hi, I'm Keegan Lillo, a front-end web software engineer based in Melbourne,
Australia.

Originally starting out as a full-stack web developer, I have since focused on
the front end working with React and Typescript. I have a strong passion for
user experience (UX) and design. I enjoy working closely with designers and
pride myself on my ability to form professional relationships based on trust and
mutual respect. I have an academic background in design and a career in software
engineering. This provides me with a unique perspective and allows me to help
bridge the gap between design and engineering teams.
