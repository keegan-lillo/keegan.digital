quote:
  content: Keegan became an invaluable part of our organisation when he was
    brought onboard to migrate all our old data and build a much-needed new
    website that would showcase hundreds of artworks online in a
    child-accessible way. Not only did he create a beautiful website in
    consultation with our organisation, he also patiently taught us how to use
    and maintain it. He continues to bring new ideas and technologies to our
    team, and he is constantly learning, researching, and developing better ways
    to improve our operations.

I joined Paintbrush Diplomacy in 2018 to lead the website redesign efforts, integrating the old Online Teaching Museum website into our current platform and making the site more beautiful and user-friendly. I am now a proud board member where I provide continued technical expertise.
